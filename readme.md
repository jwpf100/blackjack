Blackjack Game by Joe Fletcher

The game should be fairly straightforward to play.  Controls are there to change whether the app uses images or not, the number of decks dealt at the start, and the delay between cards.

Troubleshooting:

Images Loading Slowly: When running on github pages there were some delays with images loading.  To address this select "Show Controls" and uncheck the "Use Images" checkbox. 

Speed between turns: If this is too long/too short, select "Show Controls" and enter the desired time.

Build a simple Blackjack game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. It’s a single page, that opens in the browser, and lets the user play. You can find Blackjack’s rules here, it’s a relatively simple game. Your implementation just needs to give the "hit" and "stand" options to the player (no betting). Feel free to figure out what UI you prefer, as long as the user understands what is happening and can play multiple games.
